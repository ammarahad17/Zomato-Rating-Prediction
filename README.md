# Zomato Rating Prediction

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts restaurant ratings on Zomato, a popular online restaurant discovery and food delivery platform. The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights to both users and restaurant owners, helping them make informed choices and improvements.

## Project Details

### Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used:** ExtraTreesRegressor
- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was carefully preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** The ExtraTreesRegressor was trained on the preprocessed data, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to achieve the best performance.

### Deployment
- **Web Framework:** Flask was used to create a user-friendly web application for the deployment of the machine learning model.
- **Endpoints:** The Flask app includes endpoints for receiving user input and returning predictions.
- **User Interface (UI):** The user interface was developed using HTML and CSS, providing a seamless experience for users to input restaurant attributes and receive predicted ratings.
